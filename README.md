# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject

## The run_analysis.R script reads the "subject", "X", and "y" files in both the "train" and "test" directories. Only the features that are a mean or standard deviation are used from the "X" files. It combines them into a tidy data set with appropriate column names and activity descriptions.
## The output file from the run_analysis.R script contains the mean subsetted by subject and activity for the the mean and standard deviation features from many different measurements. Each row corresponds to a different subject and activity combination (30 subjects, 6 activities = 180 rows).
## Subject:  1-30
## Activity:  Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
